# TASK 02

Write a function that takes two (2) numbers as arguments and then adds those two (2) numbers together and returns the sum.

Create a script file called `math.js` that exports a function `add()` that can be required using the CommonJS method. `add() should take two numbers as arguments and add them together, returning the sum.

The autograder will check for the following things:

1. Can your function be required?
2. Does your function add two numbers and return the sum?

> HINT: Remember that CommonJS and ECMAScript use different methods for exporting functions/modules. Don't mix them up or it won't work.
